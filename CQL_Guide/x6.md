What follows is a series of examples intended to illustrate the most important features of
the CQL language. This appendix was significantly influenced by a similar article on Python
at https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/

Also of interest:
* http://sqlite.org
* https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/sql

And with no further delay, CQL in 20 minutes...

```
-- Single line comments start with two dashes

/* C style comments also work
 *
 * C pre-processor features like #include and #define are generally available
 * CQL is typically run through the C pre-processor before it is compile.

/**********************************************************
 * 1. Primitive Datatypes and Operators
 *********************************************************/

-- You have numbers
3     -- an integer
3L    -- a long integer
3.5   -- a real literal
0x10  -- 16 in hex

-- Math is what you would expect
1 + 1     --> 2
8 - 1     --> 7
10 * 2    --> 20
35.0 / 5  --> 7.0

-- Modulo operation, same as C and SQLite
7 % 3    --> 1
-7 % 3   --> -1
7 % -3   --> 1
-7 % 3   --> -1

-- Bitwise operators bind left to right like in SQLite
1 | 4 & 3  -->  1  (not 0)

-- Enforce precedence with parentheses
1 + 3 * 2    --> 7
(1 + 3) * 2  --> 8

-- use 0 and 1 for bools
0    --> how to true
1    --> how to false
null --> null means "unknown" in CQL like SQLite

-- negate with not
not 0    --> 1
not 1    --> 0
not null --> null (not unknown is unknown)

-- Logical Operators
1 and 0 --> 0
0 or 1  --> 1
0 and x --> 0 and x not evaluated
1 or x  --> 1 and x not evaluated

-- remember null is "unknown"
null or 0  --> null
null or 1  --> 1
null and 0 --> 0
null and 1 --> null

-- Non-zero values are true
0        --> false
4        --> true
-6       --> true
0 and 2  --> 0 (false)
-5 or 0  --> 1 (true)

-- Equality is ==, but note unknown is not == to anything
1 == 1       --> true
1 = 1        --> true  (= and == are the same thing)
2 == 1       --> false
null == 1    --> null (hence not true)
null == null --> null (hence not true)
"x" == "x"   --> true

-- IS lets you compare against null
1 IS 1       --> true
2 IS 1       --> false
null IS 1    --> false
null IS null --> true  (Unknown is Unknown?  Yes it is!)
"x" IS "x"   --> true

-- x IS NOT y is the same as NOT (x IS y)
1 IS NOT 1       --> false
2 IS NOT 1       --> true
null IS NOT 1    --> true
null IS NOT null --> false
"x" IS NOT "x"   --> false

-- Inequality is != or <>
1 != 1       --> false
2 <> 1       --> true
null != 1    --> null
null <> null --> null

-- More comparisons
1 < 10    --> true
1 > 10    --> false
2 <= 2    --> true
2 >= 2    --> true
10 < null --> null

-- Seeing whether a value is in a range
1 < 2 and 2 < 3  --> true
2 < 3 and 3 < 2  --> false

-- BETWEEN makes this look nicer
2 BETWEEN 1 AND 3 --> true
3 BETWEEN 2 AND 2 --> false

-- Strings are created with "x" or 'x'
"This is a string.\n"           -- can have C style escapes (no embedded nulls)
"Th\x69s is a string.\n"        -- even hex literals
'This isn''t a C style string'  -- use '' to escape single quote ONLY

/**********************************************************
 * 2. Simple Variables
 *********************************************************/

-- CQL can call simple libc methods with no declaration
-- we'll need this for later examples so we can do something
-- with our expressions (i.e. print them)
call printf("I'm CQL. Nice to meet you!\n");

-- variables are declared with DECLARE
-- keywords and identifiers are not case sensitive
declare x integer not null;

-- you can call it X, it is the same thing.
set X := 0;

-- all variables begin with a null value if allowed, else a zero value.
declare y integer not null;
if y == 0 then
  call printf("Yes, this will run.\n");
end if;

-- a nullable variable (i.e. not marked with not null) initialized to null
declare z real;
if z is null then
  call printf("Yes, this will run.\n");
end if;

-- the various types
declare a_blob blob;
declare a_string text;
declare a_real real;
declare an_int integer;
declare a_long long;
declare an_object object;

-- there are some typical SQL synonyms
declare an_int int;
declare a_long long integer;
declare a_long long int;
declare a_long long_int;

-- the basic types can be tagged to make them less miscible
declare m real<meters>;
declare kg real<kilos>;

set m := kg;  -- error!

-- object variables can be tagged so that they are not mixed-up easily
declare dict object<dict> not null;
declare list object<list> not null;
set dict := create_dict();  -- an external function that creates a dict
set dict := create_list();  -- error
set list := create_list();  -- ok
set list := dict;           -- error

/**********************************************************
 * 3. Control Flow
 *********************************************************/

-- Just make a variable
declare some_var integer not null;
set some_var := 5

-- Here is an if statement
if some_var > 10 then
    call printf("some_var is totally bigger than 10.\n")
else if some_var < 10 then  -- else if is optional
    call printf("some_var is smaller than 10.\n")
else -- else is optional
    call printf("some_var is indeed 10.\n")
end if;


-- while loops iterate as usual
declare i integer not null;
set i := 0;
while i < 5
begin
   call printf("%d\n", i);
   set i := i + 1;
end;

-- use "leave" to end a loop early
declare i integer not null;
set i := 0;
while i < 500
begin
   if i >= 5 then
     -- we are not going to get anywhere near 500
     leave;
   end if;

   call printf("%d\n", i);
   set i := i + 1;
end;

-- use "continue" to go back to the loop test
declare i integer not null;
set i := 0;
while i < 500
begin
   set i := i + 1;
   if i % 2 then
     continue; -- note we had to do this after "i" was incremented!
   end if;

   -- odd numbers will not be printed because of continue above
   call printf("%d\n", i);
end;

 /**********************************************************
 * 4. Complex Expression Forms
 *********************************************************/

 -- case is an expression, so it is more like the C ?: operator
 -- than a switch statement.  It is ?: on steroids.

 case i              -- a switch expression is optional
   when 1 then "one" -- one or more cases
   when 2 then "two"
   else "other"      -- else is optional
 end;

-- case with no common expression, is a series of booleans
case
   when i == 1 then "i = one"   -- booleans could be completely unrelated
   when j == 2 then "j = two"   -- first match wins
   else "other"
end;

-- if nothing matches the result is null
case 7
  when 1 then "one"
end;

--> result null

-- case is just an expression so it can nest
case X
  when 1
    case y when 1 "x:1 y:1"
           else "x:1 y:other"
    end
  else
    case when z == 1 "x:other z:1"
         else "x:other z:other"
end;

-- IN is used to test for membership
5 IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  --> true
7 IN (1, 2)           --> false
null in (1, 2, 3)     --> null
null in (1, null, 3)  --> null  (null == null is not true)
7 NOT IN (1, 2)       --> true
null not in (null, 3) --> null

/**********************************************************
 * 4. Working and "getting rid of" null
 *********************************************************/

-- null can be annoying, you might need a not null value
-- in most operations null is radioactive
null + x     --> null
null * x     --> null
null == null --> null

-- IS and IS NOT always return 0 or 1
null is 1     -> 0
1 is not null -> 1

-- COALESCE returns the first non null argument, or the last arg if all were null
-- if the last arg is not null, you get a non null result for sure
COALESCE(x==y, 0) --> if x or y is null, you get 0 not null, not quite "is"

-- IFNULL is coalesce with 2 args only (COALESCE is more general)
IFNULL(x, -1) --> use -1 if x is null

-- the reverse, convert a sentinel value to unknown, more exotic
NULLIF(x, -1) --> if x is -1 then use null

-- the else part of a case can get rid of nulls
CASE when x == y then 1 else 0 end;  --> true iff x = y and neither is null

-- case can be used to give you a default value after various tests
-- this expression is never null, "other" is returned if x is null
CASE when x > 0 then "pos" when x < 0 then "neg" else "other" end;

-- you can "throw" out of the current procedure (see exceptions below)
declare x integer not null;
set x := ifnull_throw(nullable_int_expression); -- returns non null, throws if null

-- if you have already tested the expression you can use assert-like form
if x is not null then
  -- I am very sure nullable_int_expression is not null
  set x := ifnull_crash(nullable_int_expression);
end if;

/**********************************************************
 * 5. Tables, Views, Indices, Triggers
 *********************************************************/

-- most forms of data definition language DDL are supported
-- "loose" DDL (outside of any procedure) simply declares
-- schema, it does not actually create it, it is assumed to
-- exist as you specified.

create table T1(
  id integer primary key,
  t text,
  r real
);

create table T2(
  id integer primary key references T1(id),
  l long,
  b blob
);

-- CQL can take a series of declarations and automatically
-- create a procedure that will materialize the declarations
-- you made.  This will not be discussed here.  But you will get
-- procedures that have things like.

create proc make_tables()
begin
  create table T1 if not exists (
    id integer primary key,
    t text,
    r real
  );
end;

-- views are supported
create view V1 as (select * from T1);

-- triggers are supported
create trigger if not exists trigger1
  before delete on T1
begin
  delete from T2 where id = old.id;
end;

-- indices are supported
create index I1 on T1(t);
create index I2 on T1(r);

-- the various drop forms are supported
drop index I1;
drop index I2;
drop view V1;
drop table T2;
drop table T1;

-- a complete discussion of DDL is out of scope, refer to sqlite.org

/**********************************************************
 * 6. Selecting Data
 *********************************************************/

-- we will use this scratch variable in examples
declare rr real;

-- first observe CQL is a two-headed language
set rr := 1+1;           -- this is evaluated in generated C code
set rr := (select 1+1);  -- this select statement is sent to SQLite, it does the add

-- CQL tries to do most things the same as SQLite in the C context
-- some things are exceedingly hard to emulate correctly.  Even simply looking things
set rr := (select cast("1.23" as real));   -->  rr := 1.23
set rr := cast("1.23" as real);   -->  error

-- In general, numeric/text conversions have to happen in SQLite context
-- because the specific library that does the conversion could be and usually
-- is different.  It would not do to give different answers in one context or
-- another so those conversions are simply not supported.

-- Loose concatenation is likewise not supported because of the implied conversions
-- Loose means "not in the context of a SQL statement"
set r := 1.23;
set r := (select cast("100"||r as real));  -->  1001.23 (a number)
set r := cast("100"||r as real);  -->  error, concatenation not supported in loose expressions

-- illustrate a simple insertion
insert into T1 values (1, "foo", 3.14);

-- finally, reading from the database
set r := (select r from T1 where id = 1);  --> r = 3.14

-- the (select ...) form requires the result to have at least one row
-- you can use "if nothing" forms to handle other cases
set r := (select r from T1
          where id = 2
          if nothing -1);  --> r = -1

-- if the select statement might return a null result you can handle that as well
set r := (select r from T1
          where id = 2
          if nothing or null -1);  --> r = -1

-- with no if nothing clause, lack of a row will cause the select expression to throw
-- an exception.  "If nothing throw" merely makes this explicit.
set r := (select r from T1 where id = 2 if nothing throw);  --> will throw

/**********************************************************
 * 6. Procedures, Results, Exceptions
 *********************************************************/

-- procedures are a list of statements that can be executed with arguments
create proc hello()
begin
  call printf("Hello, world\n");
end;

-- in, out, and in/out parameters are possible
create proc swizzle(x integer, inout y integer, out z real not null)
begin
  set y := x + y;  -- any computation you like

  -- bizarre way to compute an id but this is just an illustration
  set z := (select r from T1 where id = x if nothing or null -1);
end;

-- procedures like "hello" have a void signature, they return nothing
-- as nothing can go wrong but those that use the database like "swizzle"
-- can return an error code if there is a problem.
-- will_fail will always return SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, the second insert is said to "throw"
create proc will_fail()
begin
   insert into T1 values (1, "x", 1);
   insert into T1 values (1, "x", 1);  --> duplicate key
end;

-- exceptions can be caught, here is an examples
create proc upsert_t1(
  id_ integer primary key,
  t_ text,
  r_ real
)
begin
  begin try
    insert into T1(id, t, r) values (id_, t_, r_);
  end try;
  begin catch
    update T1 set t = t_, r = r_ where id = id_;
  end catch;
end;

-- shapes can be very useful in avoiding boilerplate code
-- the following is equivalent, more on shapes later
create proc upsert_t1(LIKE t1) -- my args are the same as the columns of T1
begin
  begin try
    insert into T1 from arguments
  end try;
  begin catch
    update T1 set t = t_, r = r_ where id = id_;
  end catch;
end;

-- you can throw an error explicitly (if there is no current error you get SQLITE_ERROR)
create proc upsert_wrapper(LIKE t1) -- my args are the same as the columns of T1
begin
  if r_ > 10 then throw end if;
  call upsert_t1(from arguments);
end;

-- procedures can also produce a result set
-- the compiler generates the code to create this result set
-- and helper functions to read rows out of it
create proc get_low_r(r_ real)
begin
   -- optionally insert some rows or do other things
   select * from T1 where T1.r <= r_;
end;

-- a procedure can choose between various results, they must be compatible
-- the last "select" to run controls the ultimate result
create proc get_hi_or_low(r_ real, hi_not_low bool not null)
begin
  if hi_not_ low then
    select * from T1 where T1.r >= r_; -- economical easy query
  else
    select * from T1 where T1.r <= r_; -- economical easy query
  end if;
end;

-- using IF to create to nice selects above is a powerful thing.
-- SQLite has no IF, if we tried to create a shared query we get
-- something that does not use indices at all.  As in the below.
-- The two-headed beast has its advantages.
select * from T1 where case hi_not_low then T1.r >= r_ else T1.r <= r_ end;

-- you can get the current return code to help you manage your catch things
-- this upsert is a bit better than the first
create proc upsert_t1(LIKE t1) -- my args are the same as the columns of T1
begin
  begin try
    insert into T1 from arguments
  end try;
  begin catch;
    if @rc == 19 /* SQLITE_CONSTRAINT */ then
      update T1 set t = t_, r = r_ where id = id_;
    else
      throw;  -- rethrow, something bad happened.
    end if;
  end catch;
end;

-- By convention you can call a proc with an out parameter as its last arg
-- using function notation.  The out variable is the return value
-- If the proc uses the database it could throw which causes the caller to throw
create proc fib(n integer not null, out result integer not null)
begin
   result := case n <= 2 then 1 else fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) end;
end;

/**********************************************************
 * 7. Statement Cursors
 *********************************************************/

-- statement cursors let you iterate over a select result
-- here we introduce cursors loop and fetch
create proc count_t1(r_ real, out rows_ integer not null)
begin
  declare rows integer not null;  -- starts at zero guaranteed
  declare C cursor for select * from T1 where r < r_;
  loop fetch C -- iterate until fetch returns no row
  begin

   open C;   -- this is no-op, present because other systems have it, no code generated
   fetch C;
   if C then  -- cursor name indicates presence of a row, fetch might find none!
     set rows_ = rows_ + (C.r < 5);
     fetch C;
     set rows_ = rows_ + (C and C.r < 5);
   end if;
   close C;  -- cursors closed automatically at end of method but early close possible
end;

-- the fetch form can also fetch directly into variables
fetch C into id_, t_, r_;  --> loads named locals instead of C.id, C.t, C.r

-- a procedure can be the source of a cursor
declare C cursor for call get_low_r(3.2);  -- valid cursor source

-- "out" can be used to create a result set that is just one row
create proc one_t1(r_ real)
begin
   declare C cursor for select * from T1 where r < r_ limit 1;
   fetch C;
   out C;  -- emits a row if we have one, no row is ok too, empty result set.
end;

/**********************************************************
 * 8. Value Cursors, Out, and Out Union
 *********************************************************/

-- to consume a procedure that uses "out" you can declare a value cursor
-- this does not imply the use of the database (unless the source uses the database)

/**********************************************************
 * 9. Named Types and Enumerations
 *********************************************************/

-- create a simple named types
declare my_type type integer not null;   -- make an alias for integer not null
declare i my_type;  -- use it, "i" is an integer

-- mixing in type kinds is helpful
declare distance type real<meters>;     -- indicating distances to be measured in meters
declare time type real<seconds>;        -- indicating time to be measured in seconds
declare job_id type long<job_id>;  
declare person_id type long<person_id>;  

-- variables/columns of type distance are not compatible with variables of type time
-- variables/columns of types job_id are not compatible with person_id

/**********************************************************
 * 10. Shapes and Their Uses
 *********************************************************/

-- shapes first appeared to help define value cursors like so:

-- a table or view name defines a shape
declare C cursor like T1;       

-- the result of a proc defines a shape
declare D cursor like one_t1;

-- a dummy select statement defines a shape (the select does not run)
-- this one is the same as (x integer not null, y text not null)
declare E cursor like select 1 x, "2" y;

-- another cursor defines a shape
declare F cursor like C;

-- the arguments of a procedure define a shape
-- create proc count_t1(r_ real, out rows_ integer not null) ...
-- the shape will be:
--  (r_ real, rows_ integer not null)
declare G cursor like count_t1 arguments;

-- a loaded cursor can be used to make a call
call count_t1(from G);  -- the args become G.r_, G.rows_

-- a shape can be used to define a functions args, or some of the args
-- p will have args id_, t_, and r_ with types matching table T1
-- note that an _ was added
create proc p(like T1) 
begin 
  -- do something
end;

-- the arguments of the current procedure are a synthetic shape
-- called "arguments" and can used where other shapes can appeared
-- for instance you can have q shim to p using this form:
create proc q(like T1, print bool not null)
begin
  -- maybe pre-process, silly example
  set id_ := id_ + 1;
  call p(from arguments);
  -- maybe post-process, silly example
  set r_ := r_ - 1;
  if print then
    -- convert args to cursor
    declare C like q arguments;
    fetch C from arguments;
    call printf("%s\n", cql_cursor_format(C));  --> prints every column and value
  end if;
  -- insert a row based on the args
  insert into T1 from arguments;
end;

-- you an use a given shape more than once if you name them
-- more exciting if T1 was like a "person" or something
create proc r(a like T1, b like T1)
begin
  call p(from a);
  call p(from b);
  -- you can refer to a.id, b.id etc.
  declare C like a;
  fetch C from a;
  call printf("%s\n", cql_cursor_format(C));
  fetch C from b;
  call printf("%s\n", cql_cursor_format(C));
end;

-- shapes can be subsetted for instance
-- here not just the arguments that match C are copied, there could be more
fetch C from arguments(like C);  

-- use the D shape to load C, defaults for other arguments
fetch C(like D) from D;

-- use the D shape to load C, dummy values for the others
-- dummy seed here means use "11" for any numerics and "col_name_11" for any strings/blobs
fetch C(like D) from D @dummy_seed(11);

-- use the Z shape to control which fields are copied
-- use the dummy value even if the field is nullable and null woud have be ok
fetch C(like Z) from D(like Z) @dummy_seed(11) @dummy_nullables;

-- same works for insert statements
insert into T1(like Z) from D(like Z) @dummy_seed(11) @dummy_nullables;

-- you can make a helper to create test args that are mostly constant
-- or computable
create get_foo_args(X like some_shape, seed_ integer not null)

-- the FETCH statement can also be "fetch using"
