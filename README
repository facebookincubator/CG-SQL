./test.sh

./cov.sh

This will run the test scripts with the coverage flag, which causes the coverage build.
If the tests pass a coverage report is created.

AMALGAM BUILD
-------------

The amalgam is created by ./make_amalgam.sh and the result is in out/cql_amalgam.c

You can create and test the amalgam in one step (preferred) using

./test.sh --use_amalgam

This will cause the amalgam to be created and compiled.  Then the test suite will run against that binary.
