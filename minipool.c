// This is the stupidest pool allocator ever, it's only useful for cases where everything lives
// until the end.  Currently it's used to hold ast nodes and duplicated strings.  It may hold
// more.  The old CQL strategy was to just let exit clean up everything since we were only
// an executable and we can't free the tree until we're exiting anyway.  However there is some
// desire to use CQL in library form now which means it has to be able to do a compile and
// then end up clean.  To help with this we make these ultra-dumb pools that simply keep 
// the allocated items together.  This means that we don't have to do zillions of seperate free
// calls when we're exiting.  It also helps with locality and fragmentation in the client.
// It's dumb as rocks.

// we allocate a new block and thread it into the list.  Note
// that this is different than the other CQL helper bytebuf.
// This allocation never moves bytes or copies bytes.  Once 
// you get memory it is valid until you close the buffer.
// Bytebuf cannot hold pointers because the structure moves when it
// grows and it is one continuous allocation so it's only for byte streams.
