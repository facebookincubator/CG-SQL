The idea is that a very large query\ncan be represented in "fragments" that add columns or add rows based on the original "core" query.  The final query\nwill be an assembled rewrite of all the fragments chained together.  Specifically, the motivation for this is that you\ncan have a "core" query that fetches the essential columns for some UI design and then you can add query extension\nfragments that add new/additional columns for some new set of features.  The core and extended columns can be in their\nown fragment and they can be compiled independently.
