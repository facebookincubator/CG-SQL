Many teams use some kind of code generation to avoid having to change dozens of ordinals every time a column is added, but these can be error prone. The CQL compiler in CG/SQL allows you to create highly complex stored procedures with very large queries and with a combination of syntax helpers and strong typing these procedures are much easier to get right and keep right. The combination of strong typing in the language plus facilities for good unit testing can provide confidence that even very complex logic is correct.
